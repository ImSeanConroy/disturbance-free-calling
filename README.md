# Disturbance Free Calling

Minimising disturbances to enable productive remote work - In today's remote work environment, unintentional interruptions can disrupt productivity and professional communication. This project tackles the challenge by creating a IoT-driven indicator designed to signal your availability and minimize disturbances during critical work activities like calls and meetings.

This is version 2.0 of the system, building on the foundations of the [original version](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6930081862153342977) developed in 2020. The initial solution utilized an ESP32 microcontroller to poll the Webex API for status updates, displaying availability through an LED strip. While effective, areas for improvement were identified in terms of performance, reliability, and design.
